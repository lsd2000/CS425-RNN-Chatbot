# Chatbot with Sequence-to-Sequence Model

This is a Python code that implements a chatbot using a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism. The chatbot takes input sentences (questions) and generates corresponding output sentences (answers) in a conversational manner.

## Overview

The code is divided into the following main sections:

1. **Reading the Data**: The code reads input data from a file containing pairs of questions and answers.

2. **Tokenizing and Preprocessing**: The input sentences (questions and answers) are tokenized and preprocessed for further processing.

3. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and validation sets.

4. **Model Architecture**: The code defines the architecture of the encoder and decoder models.

5. **Training Pipeline**: The training pipeline includes functions for training the model, calculating loss, and validating the model.

6. **Learning Rate Schedule**: An adaptive learning rate schedule is defined to adjust the learning rate during training.

7. **Training Loop**: The model is trained for a specified number of epochs using the defined pipeline.

8. **Model Saving**: The trained encoder and decoder models are saved to files and then zipped.

9. **Inference and Testing**: The code provides a function to test the chatbot by providing a question and receiving a predicted answer.

## Requirements

- Python (tested with version 3.7)
- TensorFlow (tested with version 2.5)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your data is formatted correctly in a file named "Dataset - Final.txt" where each line contains a question and its corresponding answer separated by a tab.

2. **Training**: Run the code to train the chatbot model. The trained encoder and decoder models will be saved to files "encoder_final" and "decoder_final."

3. **Testing the Chatbot**: After training, you can test the chatbot using the `test` function provided in the code. Simply call the function with a question as an argument, and it will generate a predicted answer.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to suit your needs. You can adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, or add more preprocessing steps as required.
